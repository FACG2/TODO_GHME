# How we work and share tasks :

> ### **At the start we have to make test cases for the todoFunctions .So we spitted down the functions into two's every pair have a two functions , we work as pair programming to implementing the function through the test cases,and we tried to cover all possible scenarios to keep every thing controlled.**

# How did we handle the task :
> We worked in pairs, one did the thinking and the other did the coding, and then we switched the roles. After finishing building the test , we sketched how our app look gonna and how it's gonna satisfies the user story that we had .

# Using the TDD functions to build the app :
> ### **In the dom file , we create the node component and we appended the tasks description and the buttons to each node.**

In this part of the project , we build the template for the todo app .
